description:
 Checks the current state of a ZFS storage pool. The information
 is read by the agent from {zpool status -vt} if {zpool status -x} returns
 a healthy pool. Otherwise it will only return the state of the faulty zpool.
 This is done because the verbose listing of a unhealthy pool might take quite
 long if it is in a really bad state. If an inventoried zpool has been
 destroyed or has an error the check goes CRITICAL.
 If the extend state information from zpool status indicates any CRC or
 other errors, the check will go to WARNING.

discovery:
 One service is created for each host if there are any pools.
